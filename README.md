📝 Features
Post Creation:
Users can create new posts with ease.

Nested Comments:
Comments are displayed in a nested structure, visually organized with clear hierarchy.

Commenting System:
Users can add comments to posts or as replies to existing comments.

Mock Data Integration:
Pre-loaded mock posts and comments to simulate a fully populated page.

Clean Codebase:

Organized with separation of concerns (components, hooks, and utilities).
TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
Styling:
Responsive design using SCSS for modular and reusable styles.

🛠️ Tech Stack
React: For building the user interface.
TypeScript: To ensure code quality and type safety.
SCSS: Modular styling for maintainability.
UI Libraries: Material-UI (optional) for streamlined design components.

🧰 How It Works
Mock Data: Stored in src/data/mockData.ts. This data is used to populate the page with example posts and comments.
Components: Reusable components for posts and comments, designed with modular SCSS styling.
Nested Comments: A recursive approach is used to render comments and their replies dynamically.
🛡️ Requirements Checklist
 Built with React and TypeScript.
 Nested comments displayed with a clear visual hierarchy.
 Styled using SCSS for modularity.
 Codebase is clean, maintainable, and organized.
 Well-documented with meaningful comments and a clear README.
 Mock data simulates posts and comments.
 Functional frontend submitted via GitHub repository.
🤔 Architectural Decisions
Why TypeScript?
To enhance type safety and ensure a more robust, maintainable codebase.

Why SCSS?
SCSS provides modular and reusable styling, making it easier to maintain and extend styles for components.

Nested Comments
A recursive function is used to render nested comments, ensuring flexibility for deeply nested structures.

📊 Evaluation Criteria
