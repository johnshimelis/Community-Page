🧠 Architectural Decisions

Why TypeScript?
TypeScript enforces type safety, improves code maintainability, and reduces runtime errors, making the codebase more robust and scalable.

Why SCSS?
SCSS provides modular and reusable styles, making it easier to maintain and scale the project's design.

Nested Comments
A recursive approach is used to render comments and their replies. This ensures flexibility for deeply nested structures and allows seamless rendering of hierarchical data.
